## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — a critical initial step in any data analytics or data science workflow. The image above illustrates the major components of EDA that have been implemented and explored in this project:

1. **Database Exploration**  
   Understanding the overall structure, volume, and data types in the dataset.

2. **Dimensions Exploration**  
   Analyzing categorical fields such as city, country, cuisine types, etc.

3. **Date Exploration**  
   Studying time-based patterns such as trends over years or months.

4. **Measures Exploration**  
   Exploring numerical fields like ratings, cost, votes, and other continuous variables.

5. **Magnitude**  
   Measuring volume and comparative distribution to derive actionable insights.

6. **Ranking**  
   Identifying Top N and Bottom N performers — e.g., top-rated restaurants, most reviewed places.

These analyses were conducted using tools such as:
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **SQL**
- **Tableau**
- **Power BI**
- **Excel**
